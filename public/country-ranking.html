<h1>The Best Travel Destinations</h1>
<h2>The best countries I've traveled to since moving to Dubai!</h2>

<hr/>

<h2>Antarctica</h2>
<p>
    From penguin colonies to an insane number of iceberg variations, this is the top of my list!
</p>

<h2>Philippines</h2>
<p>
    The hospitality of the people, the amazing nature, and the surfing culture made me want to go back ASAP!
</p>

<h2>Georgia</h2>
<p>
    Whether I was being forced to drink chacha, hike some amazing mountains, or eat a delicious kinkali for very little money, it would be offensive not to include this one.
